[6@] temperature & max_tokens 

the temperature and max_tokens parameters can be used to control the mode of responding of a chatbot.

Temperature controls the creativity of the chatbot's responses. A higher temperature results in more creative and original responses, but also less accurate responses. A lower temperature results in more accurate responses, but also less creative and original responses.

Max_tokens controls the length of the chatbot's responses. A higher max_tokens value results in longer responses, but also more verbose and less concise responses. A lower max_tokens value results in shorter responses, but also more concise and less verbose responses


1*** EXPLANATION

[1@] There are a few other ways to train a chatbot without using OpenAI. You can get an API key from them

- Hugging Face's Transformers: This is a free and open-source library that provides pre-trained language models, including GPT-3. You can use these models to train your own chatbot without having to create an OpenAI account.

- Google AI's LaMDA: This is a large language model that is similar to GPT-3. You can use LaMDA to train your own chatbot, but you will need to have a Google Cloud Platform account.

- Rasa Open Source: This is a framework for building chatbots. It does not use any pre-trained language models, so you will need to collect your own training data. However, Rasa Open Source is free and open-source, so it is a good option if you are on a budget.

- Microsoft's Bot Framework: This is another framework for building chatbots. It uses pre-trained language models, so you do not need to collect your own training data. However, the Bot Framework is not free, so it is a good option if you are willing to pay for a subscription.

<*> Here are the steps on how to get an API key from Hugging Face:

- Go to the Hugging Face website: https://huggingface.co/.

- Click on the Sign in button in the top right corner of the page.

- If you don't have an account, click on the Create account button.

- Once you are logged in, click on the Profile tab in the top right corner of the page. 

- Click on the API tokens tab.

- Click on the New token button.

- Give your token a name and click on the Generate token button.

- Your API key will be displayed. Copy it and save it in a safe place.

Once you have an API key from Hugging Face, you can replace the API key of OpenAI in the code you have provided. To do this, you will need to find the line that says openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY". Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key from Hugging Face.

# Set up OpenAI API credentials
openai.api_key = "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"


[2@] Since OpenAI is not available in your country, you cannot get an API key from them. There are a few other options available to you.

- Use a different language model, such as GPT-J or Jurassic-1 Jumbo, which are available for free.

- Use a framework for building chatbots, such as Rasa Open Source or Microsoft's Bot Framework. These frameworks do not require an API key, but you will need to collect your own training data.

- Build your own chatbot from scratch using a natural language processing library, such as spaCy or NLTK. This will require more technical knowledge, but it gives you the most flexibility.

[3@] openai.Completion.create() 

OpenAI's Completion.create() function is a powerful tool for generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way. It is powered by a large language model, which is a type of artificial intelligence that has been trained on a massive dataset of text and code.

To use the Completion.create() function, you need to provide it with a prompt. The prompt can be any text string, but it should be as specific as possible. For example, if you want the chatbot to generate a poem, you could provide the following prompt: 

-> Write a poem about a cat.

If you want the chatbot to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, you could provide the following prompt:

-> Translate the sentence "I love cats" into Spanish.

The Completion.create() function will then generate a text completion based on the prompt you provided. The completion can be any length, from a single sentence to a multi-paragraph essay.

Here are some additional parameters that you can specify when calling the Completion.create() function:

- engine: The engine to use to generate the completion. The default engine is text-davinci-003.

- temperature: The temperature to use to generate the completion. A higher temperature will result in more creative and original completions, but it may also result in less accurate completions. A lower temperature will result in more accurate completions, but it may also result in less creative and original completions.

- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The default value is 100 tokens.

Once you have specified all of the parameters, you can call the Completion.create() function and it will return a completion based on your prompt.

The Completion.create() function is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks. It is still under development, but it has already learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including:

- Generating different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.

- Translating languages

- Writing different kinds of creative content

- Answering your questions in an informative way

[4@] text-davinci-003 

text-davinci-003 is a large language model from OpenAI that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

text-davinci-003 is one of the most powerful language models available today. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

- Generating creative text formats, such as poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
- Translating languages
- Writing different kinds of creative content, such as stories, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
- Answering your questions in an informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.

text-davinci-003 is still under development, but it has already learned to perform many kinds of tasks that were previously thought to be impossible for machines. It is a powerful tool that can be used to create new and innovative products and services.

One of the things that makes text-davinci-003 so powerful is its ability to learn from its mistakes. The more it is used, the better it becomes at generating text, translating languages, writing creative content, and answering questions.

text-davinci-003 is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to create or consume text. It can be used to improve the quality of your writing, to learn new things, and to be more creative.

[5@] "role": "system", "content": "You are a chatbot that helps with hotel booking and weather queries."

The role: "system", "content" prompt is used to tell the OpenAI API that the following text is a system message. This is important because the OpenAI API uses the role of a message to determine how to generate a response.

For example, if the user asks the chatbot "What's the weather like in New York City?", the chatbot will generate a response that is different from the response it would generate if the user asked "I want to book a hotel in New York City."

The role: "system", "content" prompt helps the chatbot to understand that the first message is a system message that tells the chatbot what its role is. This allows the chatbot to generate a response that is relevant to its role.

In the example you provided, the role: "system", "content" prompt tells the OpenAI API that the following text is a system message that tells the chatbot that it is a chatbot that helps with hotel booking and weather queries. This helps the chatbot to understand its role and to generate responses that are relevant to its role.

[7@] the 'temperature' parameter for openai.Completion.create(). how much temperature is supposed to be high and low ? 

The temperature parameter for OpenAI's Completion API controls the creativity and randomness of the generated text. A lower temperature will result in more predictable and factual responses, while a higher temperature will result in more creative and imaginative responses.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how high or low the temperature parameter should be. The optimal temperature will vary depending on the specific task that you are trying to accomplish.

Here are some general guidelines for choosing a temperature:

* For tasks that require factual and informative responses, such as generating summaries or answering questions, a lower temperature is generally better.
* For tasks that require creative and imaginative responses, such as generating poems, stories, or code, a higher temperature is generally better.
* For tasks that require a balance of factual and creative responses, such as generating marketing copy or product descriptions, a medium temperature is often a good choice.

You can also experiment with different temperature settings to see what works best for your specific needs.

Here are some examples of how different temperature settings can affect the output of the Completion API:

**Temperature = 0.5:**

> **Prompt:** Write a poem about a cat.

> **Output:**

> A cat is a feline,
> It's furry and fine.
> It has four legs,
> And a tail that wags.

**Temperature = 1.0:**

> **Prompt:** Write a poem about a cat.

> **Output:**

> The cat is a mystical creature,
> With eyes that gleam like emeralds.
> It slinks through the shadows,
> A silent predator.

**Temperature = 2.0:**

> **Prompt:** Write a poem about a cat.

> **Output:**

> The cat is a cosmic being,
> From a distant galaxy.
> It has nine lives,
> And knows the secrets of the universe.

As you can see, the temperature parameter has a significant impact on the creativity and randomness of the generated text.

[8@] Meaning of query in programming ?

In programming, a query is a request for information from a data source, such as a database or a file. Queries can be used to retrieve specific data, perform calculations on data, or manipulate data.

Queries are typically written in a specific query language, such as Structured Query Language (SQL) for databases. SQL queries can be used to perform a wide range of operations, such as:

* Selecting specific data from a database table
* Filtering data based on certain criteria
* Joining data from multiple tables
* Grouping data and performing calculations on groups
* Inserting, updating, or deleting data

Queries can also be used to request information from other types of data sources, such as files or APIs. For example, a query could be used to read a file line by line, or to retrieve data from a web service.

Queries are an essential part of many programming applications. They allow developers to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data, which can save time and improve the performance of their applications.

Here is a simple example of a SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';
```

This query will select all of the data from the `customers` table where the `country` column is equal to `USA`.

Another example is a query that could be used to read a file line by line:

```python
def read_file(filename):
  with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
      yield line
```

This function uses a generator to read the file line by line. The `yield` statement returns the current line of the file and then suspends the function until the next time it is called. This allows the function to be used in a for loop to iterate over the lines of the file.

Queries are a powerful tool that can be used to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data in a variety of programming applications.

[9@] If OpenAI is not available in your country, there are a number of other open source AI APIs that you can use

If OpenAI is not available in your country, there are a number of other open source AI APIs that you can use. Some popular options include:

* **Hugging Face Transformers:** This library provides a number of pre-trained AI models that can be used for a variety of tasks, including text classification, translation, and question answering.
* **AllenNLP:** This library provides a number of tools for natural language processing, including named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
* **spaCy:** This library provides a number of tools for natural language processing, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

To use any of these APIs, you will need to install the corresponding library and create an account with the API provider. Once you have done this, you can follow the documentation for the API to generate text, translate languages, and answer your questions.

Here is a simple example of how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to generate text:

```python
import transformers

# Load the GPT-Neo model
model = transformers.GPTNeoModel.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")

# Generate text
text = model.generate(
    input_ids=[0],
    max_length=100,
    num_beams=5,
    repetition_penalty=2.0,
    length_penalty=1.0,
    early_stopping=True,
)

# Print the generated text
print(text)
```

This code will generate 100 tokens of text from the GPT-Neo model. You can adjust the `max_length` and `num_beams` parameters to control the length and quality of the generated text.

<10@> Numpy

NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is widely used in various fields such as data science, machine learning, and scientific research.

<11@> brief explanation of Building a.i chatbox by using Tensorflow

Your code looks good. You have imported the necessary libraries and prepared the training data. You have also created a tokenizer to convert the text data into numerical sequences.

Here is a brief explanation of each step in your code:

**Step 1: Install TensorFlow (if not already installed)**

You need to install TensorFlow before you can run your code. You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

**Step 2: Prepare the training data**

You have created a list of training data, which consists of pairs of sentences. Each pair of sentences consists of an input sentence and a target sentence. The target sentence is the response that the chatbot should generate for the input sentence.

**Step 3: Preprocess the training data**

You have used a tokenizer to convert the text data into numerical sequences. This is necessary because TensorFlow can only process numerical data.

**Step 4: Prepare the input and output sequences**

You have padded the input sequences to ensure that they all have the same length. This is necessary because TensorFlow cannot process sequences of different lengths.

You have also converted the output labels into categorical variables. This is necessary because TensorFlow uses categorical cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.

**Step 5: Build and train the model**

You have built a sequential model with three layers:

* An embedding layer to convert the numerical sequences into dense vectors.
* An LSTM layer to learn long-range dependencies in the data.
* A dense layer to generate the output predictions.

You have compiled the model using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. You have also trained the model for 100 epochs.

**Step 6: Generate responses**

You have created a function called `generate_response()` to generate responses for input sentences. This function takes an input sentence as input and returns a response sentence as output.

The function works by first converting the input sentence into a numerical sequence. Then, it passes the numerical sequence to the model to generate a prediction. The prediction is a categorical variable, so the function converts it back to a sentence using the tokenizer.

**Example usage:**

```python
user_input = "hello"
response = generate_response(user_input)
print(response)
```

Output:

```
hi, nice to meet you
```

Overall, your code is well-written and easy to understand. You have used the TensorFlow library to build and train a chatbot model. You have also created a function to generate responses for input sentences.

<11@> multi-dimensional arrays and matrices

Multi-dimensional arrays and matrices are data structures used in computer programming and mathematics to store and manipulate data in multiple dimensions or dimensions beyond the usual one-dimensional structure of a regular array.

A multi-dimensional array is an array that can store data in more than one dimension. In a one-dimensional array, data is stored in a linear sequence, while in a multi-dimensional array, data is stored in a grid-like structure with rows and columns or even more dimensions. For example, a two-dimensional array can be visualized as a table with rows and columns, where each element can be accessed using two indices.

Matrices, on the other hand, are a specific type of multi-dimensional array with two dimensions. Matrices are often used in mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, to represent and solve systems of equations, perform matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and find determinants or inverses.

Both multi-dimensional arrays and matrices are used in various applications, such as image processing, scientific simulations, data analysis, and machine learning algorithms. They provide a convenient way to organize and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently, especially when dealing with data that has multiple dimensions or complex relationships between elements.

<12@> tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text & tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence

`tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text` and `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence` are two modules in the TensorFlow library that provide utilities for preprocessing text data for machine learning.

**`tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text`** provides the following utilities:

* **Tokenizer:** A class for converting text data into numerical sequences.
* **HashingTrick:** A class for converting text data into sparse vectors using a hashing trick.
* **OneHot:** A class for converting text data into one-hot vectors.
* **text_to_word_sequence:** A function for converting a text string into a list of words.

**`tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence`** provides the following utilities:

* **pad_sequences:** A function for padding sequences to the same length.
* **make_sampling_table:** A function for creating a sampling table for negative sampling.
* **skipgrams:** A function for generating skip-gram pairs from a text corpus.

These utilities can be used to preprocess text data for a variety of machine learning tasks, such as text classification, text generation, and question answering.

Here is an example of how to use the `Tokenizer` class to convert text data into numerical sequences:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(["hello", "world"])

# Convert the text "hello world" to a numerical sequence
sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(["hello world"])

# Print the numerical sequence
print(sequence)
```

Output:

```
[[1, 2]]
```

Here is an example of how to use the `pad_sequences` function to pad sequences to the same length:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

sequences = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]

# Pad the sequences to a length of 5
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=5)

# Print the padded sequences
print(padded_sequences)
```

Output:

```
[[0 0 1 2 0]
 [0 3 4 5 0]]
```

You can use the utilities in `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text` and `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence` to preprocess text data for a variety of machine learning tasks. These utilities can help you to improve the accuracy and performance of your machine learning models.

<13@> tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(training_data)

total_words = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1
input_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(training_data)

The code you provided is for creating a tokenizer and using it to preprocess the training data.

**Tokenizer:** A tokenizer is a class that converts text data into sequences of integers. It does this by first creating a vocabulary of all the unique words in the training data. Then, it assigns each word a unique integer index. Once the vocabulary is created, the tokenizer can be used to convert the text data to sequences of integer indices.

**Fitting the tokenizer:** The `fit_on_texts()` method fits the tokenizer to the training data. This creates a vocabulary of all the unique words in the training data.

**Total words:** The `len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1` expression gives the total number of words in the vocabulary, including the special `UNK` token.

**Input sequences:** The `texts_to_sequences()` method converts the training data to sequences of integer indices using the tokenizer.

Here is an example of how to use the tokenizer to preprocess the training data:

```python
>>> tokenizer = Tokenizer()
>>> tokenizer.fit_on_texts(training_data)
>>> total_words = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1
>>> input_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(training_data)

>>> print(tokenizer.word_index)
{
    'UNK': 0,
    'hello': 1,
    'hi': 2,
    'nice': 3,
    'meet': 4,
    'you': 5,
    'are': 6,
    'i': 7,
    'am': 8,
    'a': 9,
    'i.': 10,
}

>>> print(input_sequences)
[[1], [2, 5, 4], [3, 5, 4, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]]
```

The preprocessed input sequences can then be used to train a chatbot model.

3*** basic instruction to buil CHAT BOX GPT with OPEN A.I


<1@> step-by-step plan to create a chatbot (based on the tutorial code)

1/ Set up the OpenAI API credentials

- As you may know, OpenAI provides powerful language models like GPT-3. To use their API, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it up in your code.

2/ Create a new chatbot

- we initialize an empty variable called chatbot. This will store the model we'll be training.

3/ Prepare training data

- The next step is to provide examples to train the chatbot. In the training_data variable, we have a list of tuples, where the first element represents the intent or action the user wants to perform (e.g., "book_hotel") and the second element is the corresponding example query or input from the user.

We'll use these examples to generate prompts and completions for training the chatbot.

4/ Train the chatbot

- In the code example, we use the openai.Completion.create() method to train the chatbot using the GPT-3 language model. We provide the prompts and completions generated from the training data, specify the engine to use ("text-davinci-003"), and set other parameters like temperature and max tokens.

The training process will fine-tune the model based on the provided training data, enabling it to generate responses for user inputs.

5/ Test the chatbot

- After training the chatbot, you can test it by simulating a conversation. In the code example, we have two test cases: one for querying weather information and another for hotel booking.

In each test case, we generate a response from the chatbot by providing the user's query as a prompt. We concatenate the chatbot's previous choices with the user's prompt to maintain context.

The generated response from the chatbot can then be used to perform further actions or provide relevant information.

-> That's the basic outline of creating a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3 model


<2@> Step 1: Set up the OpenAI API credentials

you'll need an API key from OpenAI to use their language models. If you haven't obtained an API key yet, you can visit OpenAI's website and follow their instructions to get one.

Once you have your API key, you can set it up in your code like this:

->

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"


<3@> Step 2: Create a new chatbot

we initialized an empty variable called chatbot. However, we need to create an instance of the GPT-3 model and assign it to the chatbot variable.

<THE CODE>

chatbot = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a chatbot that helps with hotel booking and weather queries."}],
    temperature=0.8,
    max_tokens=100
)

we use the openai.Completion.create() method to create the chatbot. We specify the GPT-3 engine to use ("text-davinci-003"), provide a system-level prompt that sets the context for the chatbot, and set other parameters like temperature and max tokens.

The chatbot variable now holds an instance of the GPT-3 model that we'll use for training and testing.


<4@> Step 3: Prepare training prompts and completions

In this step, we build the prompts and completions that will be used to train the chatbot. These prompts and completions are derived from the training data you have.

Let's assume you already have a list of training examples in the training_data variable.

<THE CODE>

prompts = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a chatbot that helps with hotel booking and weather queries."}]
for intent, example in training_data:
    prompts.append({"role": "user", "content": example})
    prompts.append({"role": "assistant", "content": intent})


In the code above, we create a list of prompts that includes a system-level prompt and user-assistant pairs. Each user-assistant pair represents a conversation between the user and the chatbot. 

We alternate between user and assistant roles and provide the corresponding content.
You should modify the training_data variable to match your actual training examples.


<5@> Step 4: Train the chatbot

With the training prompts and completions prepared, we can now train the chatbot. We'll use the same openai.Completion.create() method but with the training data as the prompt.

<THE CODE>

chatbot = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=prompts,
    temperature=0.8,
    max_tokens=100
)

This call to the openai.Completion.create() method will train the chatbot using the provided prompts and completions. It will fine-tune the model to generate relevant and coherent responses based on the training data.


<6@> Step 5: Test the chatbot

After training the chatbot, it's time to test it by simulating a conversation. In the previous code example, we had two test cases: querying weather information and hotel booking.
Let's walk through the code for querying weather information:

<THE CODE>

query = "What's the weather like?"
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=[{"role": "user", "content": query}] + chatbot.choices,
    temperature=0.8,
    max_tokens=50
)
weather_output = response.choices[0].text.strip()

In the code above, we define a query variable with the user's input ("What's the weather like?").
We then call the openai.Completion.create() method, providing the GPT-3 engine, the user's query as a prompt, and concatenating the chatbot's previous choices with chatbot.choices. This helps maintain context for the chatbot's response.

We also set parameters like temperature and max tokens to control the generated response.
Finally, we extract the text from the response and assign it to the weather_output variable.


<7@> Step 6: Perform actions or provide information

Now that we have the chatbot's response, we can perform further actions based on that information. In the case of weather information, we can simply print it out:

->

print(weather_output)

You can customize this step based on your requirements. For example, you could use the response to make an API call to a weather service or extract specific information from the generated text.


<8@> Step 7: Iterate and refine

After testing the chatbot, it's essential to iterate and refine its responses.

You can continue adding more training examples, adjusting the training parameters (e.g., temperature), or even considering user feedback.

The goal is to improve the chatbot's performance and make it more accurate and helpful over time.
