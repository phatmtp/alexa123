1/ how do commutator work ? <1@,1***>
2/ so you mean that any motor with the magnetic field produced by the magnets surrounding the coils. if i remove the commutator from it, i can turn it to be ac generator ? <2@,1***>
3/ can you explain how the dc current cause rotation on commutator ? <3@,1***>
4/ the current reverse ? <4@,1***>
5/ the BLDC controler circuit <5@,1***>
6/ why do we need transistor to bldc controler circuit ? <6@,1***>
7/ why do we need 10k ohm resistor for bldc controler circuit ? <7@,1***>
8/ why do we need 1N4007 diode to bldc controler circuit ? <8@,1***>
9/ The number of turns in each winding determines the voltage ratio. example from million volts to 220 volts. can you tell me about how the winding ration it is ? <9@,1***>
10/ main components of power grid's transformer <10@,1***>
