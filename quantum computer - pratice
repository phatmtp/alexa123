1/ what can i do with quantum physic ? <1@,1***>
2/ quantum computer <2@,1***>
3/ Building a quantum computer <3@,1***>
4/ is there any a.i or robot that power by quantum computer ? <4@,1***>
5/ encryption algorithms <5@,1***>
6/ so if i wanna build a quantum computer, i have to choose a suitable qbit architechture <6@,1***>
7/ i see the quantum computer is settled to a friedge <7@,1***>
8/ how about quantum internet. does it need server ? <8@,1***>
9/ so to build the quantum computer, we need to afford 2 important condictions. First, the atmosphere's temperature must be as coldest as possible. Second, the energy which use to power quantum computer must be as slowest as possible <9@,1***>
10/ how much voltage and ampere does regular quantum computer need ? <10@,1***>
11/ so which mean that quantum computer has less power consumption than classical computer ? <11@,1***>
12/ what is atomic clock ? <12@,1***>
13/ what is microelectronic devices ? <13@,1***>
14/ when i shoot a gun. there is force that push me and the gun backward. what kind of force is that ? <14@,1***>
15/ what kind of superconductor material are you mentioning about for quantum levitation ? <15@,1***>
16/ popular model of quantum computer ? <16@,1***>
17/ Machine learning & A.i quantum computer models <17@,1***>
18/ Building a quantum computer with superconducting qubits <18@,1***>


2*** explanation

1/ basic part of quantum computer <1@,2***>
2/ How quantum computer work ? <2@,2***> 
3/ Here are some more examples of how quantum computers work <3@,2***>
4/ Quantum computers can develop new algorithms <4@,2***>
5/ what is quantum ? <5@,2***>
6/ so you mean that any matter has discontinues state instead continously, whether it is emiting or absorbing is the presence quantum ? <6@,2***>
7/ can you give me the example of quantum physics ? such as the photon of light <7@,2***>
8/ how about the atom ? how does quantum physiss influence on it ? <8@,2***>
9/ so you mean that in quantum physics. The electrons are understanding as the series of waves. These wave will find and catch the electrons. so which mean that the electron doesnt actually move around the nuclues by it's self. It got caught by the waves. Those waves are the quantum <9@,2***>
10/ why do we need to put the quantum computer at the absolute 0 degree ? does it has anything to do with zero point energy ? <10@,2***>
11/ what is quantum tunneling ? <11@,2***>
12/ the node interconnection of quantum computer <12@,2***>
13/ accurately summarized the key points about node interconnection in quantum computers <13@,2***>
14/ the entanglement of qbit <14@,2***>
15/ angular momentum <15@,2***>
16/ so you mean that angular momentum is the force that create and maintain rotational momentum of a object <16@,2***>
17/ quantum aspect to the angular momentum <17@,2***>
18/ so you mean that angular momentum is the answer to how the electrons can spin around the neucleus of an atom. the number of electrons spin around the neuclues meaning that only chosen discrete values allow to join the the spin. the force that make the electron's spinning and the act of choosing the appropriate particles are the quantum, which presented as angular momentum. which act on wave functions to determine the possible values of angular momentum for a given particle <18@,2***>
19/ rotational momentum to the motor <19@,2***>
20/ vector quantity <20@,2***>
21/ expell meaning in super conductive <21@,2***>
22/ what is meissner effect ? <22@,2***>
23/ can you explain to me the interaction between the external magnetic field from the magnet cube and superconductive material ? <23@,2***>
24/ but it is called superconductive material. but it wont let external magnetic go through it entirely, it repelled from the magneticfield and cause repulsion among superconductive material & the magnet cube. how ? <24@,2***>
25/ what is diamagnetism ? <25@,2***>
26/ how the diamagnetism phenomonon come to the water ? <26@,2***>
27/ how the diamagnetism phenomonon come to the copper and gold ? <27@,2***>
28/ example i put a magnet cube near a copper shaft. so according to the diamagnetism, there will be the magnetic field cause among it ? <28@,2***>
29/ what is Superconducting platforms ? <29@,2***>
30/ Classical bits are stored in dram <30@,2***>
