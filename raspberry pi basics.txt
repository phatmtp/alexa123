<17@> TMDS explain

TMDS stands for "Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling," which is the underlying technology used in HDMI cables to transmit high-speed digital signals. It is a signaling method that allows for the reliable transmission of digital audio and video data over copper wires. Here's a breakdown of how TMDS works:

- Differential Signaling: TMDS uses a differential signaling scheme, which means that it transmits data as the difference in voltage between two wires rather than relying on an absolute voltage level. This approach helps to minimize the impact of external noise and interference on the transmitted signals.

- Transition-Minimization: TMDS is designed to minimize the number of signal transitions, specifically the number of rapid voltage level changes, that occur during data transmission. By reducing the number of transitions, TMDS helps to reduce the overall electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by the signal and ensures more reliable data transmission.

- Data Encoding: Before transmission, the audio and video data is encoded using a specific algorithm. TMDS uses an encoding scheme that converts the original digital data into a series of binary 1s and 0s, which are then transmitted over the HDMI cable. This encoding helps to ensure efficient and accurate transmission of the data while maintaining compatibility with the HDMI specification.

- Clock Signal: TMDS incorporates a separate clock signal that is transmitted alongside the data signals. The clock signal provides timing information that allows the receiving device to properly interpret and reconstruct the transmitted data. By including the clock signal, TMDS ensures synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, resulting in accurate audio and video reproduction.

- Error Correction: To enhance the reliability of data transmission, TMDS employs error correction techniques. These techniques involve adding redundant data to the transmitted signals, which allows the receiving device to detect and correct any errors that may occur during transmission. Error correction helps to ensure that the received data matches the original data, minimizing the impact of signal degradation or interference.

By utilizing the TMDS technology, HDMI cables can transmit high-quality digital audio and video signals over relatively long distances while maintaining signal integrity and minimizing potential issues caused by noise or interference. This makes TMDS a crucial component of HDMI cables, enabling the seamless transmission of multimedia content between devices.

<9@> HDMI cable 

Inside an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) cable, you will find several components that work together to transmit audio and video signals between devices. Here are the main components inside an HDMI cable:

- Copper Wires: HDMI cables contain multiple copper wires that carry the audio, video, and control signals. These wires are responsible for transmitting the digital signals between the connected devices.

- Data Channels: HDMI cables have multiple data channels that carry different types of information. These channels include separate paths for video, audio, and various control signals. The specific configuration of these channels varies depending on the HDMI version (e.g., HDMI 1.4, HDMI 2.0, HDMI 2.1).

While it is true that HDMI cables primarily consist of copper wires, they are not just carrying current like traditional electrical wires. Instead, HDMI cables utilize these copper wires to transmit digital signals that represent audio, video, and control data. Here's a more detailed explanation:

- Video Signals: HDMI cables transmit digital video signals using a data transmission method called TMDS (Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling). Within the cable, there are three sets of twisted pairs of copper wires dedicated to carrying the red, green, and blue (RGB) video signals. These signals are encoded and transmitted as a series of 1s and 0s representing the color and brightness information of each pixel.

- Audio Signals: HDMI cables also transmit digital audio signals alongside video. The audio data is encoded and transmitted over a separate set of copper wires within the cable. The specific configuration of audio channels depends on the audio format being transmitted, ranging from stereo to multi-channel surround sound.

- Control Signals: In addition to audio and video, HDMI cables also carry control signals that enable communication between devices. These control signals include commands for functions like power on/off, input selection, volume control, and device synchronization. Copper wires within the HDMI cable are dedicated to transmitting these control signals, allowing for seamless device interaction.

It's important to note that HDMI cables use a digital signaling method, meaning the data is transmitted as discrete digital signals rather than analog electrical currents. This digital format ensures high-quality and lossless transmission of audio and video data, resulting in a clear and accurate representation of the original content.

The design and configuration of the copper wires within an HDMI cable, along with the use of advanced encoding techniques, allow for the transmission of complex digital signals, including audio, video, and control data. This enables HDMI cables to provide a single cable solution for connecting various multimedia devices while maintaining high-quality signal integrity.
