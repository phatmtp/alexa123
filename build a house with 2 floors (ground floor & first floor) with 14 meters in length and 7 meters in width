<1@> build a house with 2 floors (ground floor & first floor) with 14 meters in length and 7 meters in width

1. **Plan your house.** Decide on the size, shape, and features of your house. You can find shed plans online or at your local home improvement store.

2. **Prepare the site.** Clear the area where you want to build your shed and level the ground.

3. **Build the foundation.** You can use a variety of different materials to build a house foundation, such as concrete blocks, gravel, or pressure-treated wood.

4. **Frame the house.** The frame is the skeleton of your house. It is made of 2x4 lumber or metal studs.

5. **Sheathe the house.** The sheathing is the exterior skin of your house. It is typically made of plywood or oriented strand board (OSB).

6. **Install the roof.** You can use a variety of different roofing materials, such as asphalt shingles, metal roofing, or wood shingles.

7. **Install the windows and doors.** You can purchase pre-hung windows and doors from your local home improvement store.

8. **Trim and paint the shed.** Add trim pieces around the windows, doors, and roof to give your house a finished look. Then, paint or stain the shed to protect it from the elements.

Matt Risinger also provides some helpful tips in the video, such as:

* Make sure to use a level and square when building your shed to ensure that it is level and square.
* Use the correct type of nails and screws. For example, you should use galvanized nails or screws when working with pressure-treated wood.
* Leave a gap between the bottom of the shed and the ground to prevent moisture from getting into the shed.
* Paint or stain the shed to protect it from the elements.

<1@> PCC bed

A PCC bed, or plain cement concrete bed, is a layer of concrete that is placed on the ground before constructing a foundation. It is typically 75-100mm thick and is made of a mixture of cement, sand, and gravel.

The purpose of a PCC bed is to provide a smooth, level surface for the foundation to be built on. It also helps to prevent the foundation from sinking into the ground and to protect it from moisture.

PCC beds are commonly used in a variety of construction projects, including:

* Building foundations
* Constructing roads and sidewalks
* Installing retaining walls
* Laying patios and driveways

To construct a PCC bed, the ground must first be prepared by leveling it and removing any debris. The PCC bed is then poured and screeded to create a smooth, even surface. Once the PCC bed has cured, the foundation can be constructed on top of it.

Here are some of the benefits of using a PCC bed:

* It provides a smooth, level surface for the foundation to be built on.
* It helps to prevent the foundation from sinking into the ground.
* It protects the foundation from moisture.
* It helps to distribute the weight of the structure evenly.
* It reduces the risk of cracking and settlement.

PCC beds are an important part of many construction projects. They help to ensure that foundations and other structures are built on a solid base and that they will last for many years to come.

<2@> To build a house with 2 floors (ground floor & first floor) with 14 meters in length and 7 meters in width. How many foundation column should it has ? And how deep it should be ?

To calculate the number of foundation columns for a house with 2 floors (ground floor & first floor) with 14 meters in length and 7 meters in width, you can use the following formula:


Number of foundation columns = (Length of the house / Spacing of foundation columns) * (Width of the house / Spacing of foundation columns)


The spacing of foundation columns will vary depending on the type of soil and the weight of the house. For a two-story house with 14 meters in length and 7 meters in width, you may want to use a spacing of 2 meters for the foundation columns. This would give you a total of 28 foundation columns:


Number of foundation columns = (14 meters / 2 meters) * (7 meters / 2 meters) = 28 foundation columns


The depth of the foundation columns will also vary depending on the type of soil and the weight of the house. For a two-story house on average soil, you may want to use a depth of 1 meter for the foundation columns.

However, it is important to note that these are just general guidelines. The best way to determine the number and depth of foundation columns for your house is to consult with a qualified architect or engineer.

Here are some additional tips for designing the foundation of your house:

* Make sure that the foundation is deep enough to reach solid ground.
* Use a foundation material that is strong and durable.
* Make sure that the foundation is wide enough to support the weight of the house.
* Design the foundation to withstand the local climate conditions.
* Consider hiring a qualified architect or engineer to design the foundation of your house.

<3@> Rcc column

A reinforced concrete column (RCC column) is a structural member designed to carry compressive loads. It is composed of concrete with embedded steel reinforcement to provide additional strength and stiffness. RCC columns are commonly used in a variety of construction projects, including buildings, bridges, and dams.

RCC columns are typically made with a concrete mix that has a compressive strength of at least 20 MPa. The steel reinforcement is typically made of steel bars or rebar. The rebar is placed in the concrete in a specific pattern to provide the column with the required strength and stiffness.

RCC columns can be designed in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common shape is a rectangular column, but RCC columns can also be made in square, circular, and hexagonal shapes. The size of the column will depend on the load it needs to carry.

RCC columns are typically constructed by pouring concrete into a formwork. The formwork is a mold that gives the column its desired shape and size. The rebar is placed in the formwork before the concrete is poured. Once the concrete has cured, the formwork is removed.

RCC columns are strong and durable structural members that can be used to support a variety of loads. They are also relatively inexpensive to construct. As a result, RCC columns are a popular choice for a wide range of construction projects.

Here are some of the advantages of using RCC columns:

* RCC columns are strong and durable. They can carry heavy loads and withstand adverse weather conditions.
* RCC columns are relatively inexpensive to construct.
* RCC columns can be designed in a variety of shapes and sizes to meet the specific needs of a project.
* RCC columns are fire-resistant.

RCC columns are a versatile and reliable structural member that can be used in a variety of construction projects.

<4@> MPa

MPa stands for megapascal, which is a unit of pressure. It is equal to 1 million pascals. One pascal is the pressure exerted by one newton of force acting on an area of one square meter.

MPa is a commonly used unit of pressure in engineering and science. It is used to measure the pressure of fluids, gases, and solids. For example, MPa is used to measure the pressure of water in pipes, the pressure of air in tires, and the pressure of concrete in buildings.

Here are some examples of common pressure measurements in MPa:

* Atmospheric pressure: 0.1 MPa
* Water pressure in a household faucet: 0.3 MPa
* Air pressure in a car tire: 0.2 MPa
* Concrete pressure in a building: 20 MPa
* Pressure inside a hydraulic press: 100 MPa

MPa is a convenient unit of pressure because it is easy to work with and it can be used to measure a wide range of pressures. It is also a standard unit of pressure in the International System of Units (SI).

<5@> How to calculate MPa ?

To calculate MPa, you can use the following formula:

```
MPa = (Force (N)) / (Area (m^2))
```

For example, if you have a force of 1000 N acting on an area of 0.5 m^2, the pressure in MPa would be:

```
MPa = 1000 N / 0.5 m^2 = 2 MPa
```

You can also use a pressure converter to calculate MPa from other units of pressure, such as psi (pounds per square inch) or bar.

Here are some examples of how to calculate MPa in different situations:

* **Water pressure in a household faucet:**

The water pressure in a household faucet is typically around 0.3 MPa. To calculate this, you would divide the force of the water by the area of the opening of the faucet.

```
MPa = (Force of water (N)) / (Area of faucet opening (m^2))
```

* **Air pressure in a car tire:**

The air pressure in a car tire is typically around 0.2 MPa. To calculate this, you would divide the force of the air in the tire by the area of the inside of the tire.

```
MPa = (Force of air in tire (N)) / (Area of inside of tire (m^2))
```

* **Concrete pressure in a building:**

The concrete pressure in a building is typically around 20 MPa. To calculate this, you would divide the weight of the building by the area of the concrete foundation.

```
MPa = (Weight of building (N)) / (Area of concrete foundation (m^2))
```

<6@> How to calculate Newton ? 

To calculate Newton, you can use the following formula:

```
Force (N) = Mass (kg) * Acceleration (m/s²)
```

This is Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force required to accelerate an object is proportional to the mass of the object and the acceleration.

For example, if you have a mass of 10 kg and you accelerate it at a rate of 2 m/s², the force required would be 20 N.

```
Force (N) = 10 kg * 2 m/s² = 20 N
```

You can also use a force converter to calculate Newton from other units of force, such as pounds-force (lbf) or dynes.

Here are some examples of how to calculate Newton in different situations:

* **The force of gravity:**

The force of gravity on Earth is approximately 9.81 N/kg. This means that an object with a mass of 1 kg will experience a force of 9.81 N due to gravity.

* **The force required to accelerate a car:**

The force required to accelerate a car depends on the mass of the car and the desired acceleration. For example, a car with a mass of 1000 kg and an acceleration of 2 m/s² would require a force of 2000 N.

* **The force required to lift a weight:**

The force required to lift a weight is equal to the weight of the object. For example, lifting a 10 kg weight would require a force of 10 N.

<7@> m/s²

m/s² stands for meters per second squared, which is a unit of acceleration. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, which is a measure of how fast an object is moving in a particular direction.

m/s² is a vector quantity, which means that it has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the acceleration is the rate at which the object's speed is changing, and the direction of the acceleration is the direction in which the object's speed is changing.

For example, if an object is accelerating at 2 m/s², its speed is increasing by 2 meters per second every second. If the object is accelerating in the positive direction, its speed is increasing. If the object is accelerating in the negative direction, its speed is decreasing.

m/s² is a commonly used unit of acceleration in physics and engineering. It is used to measure the acceleration of objects in a variety of situations, such as the acceleration of a car, the acceleration of a falling object, and the acceleration of a rocket.

Here are some examples of common acceleration measurements in m/s²:

* Gravity: 9.81 m/s²
* Free fall: 9.81 m/s²
* Car acceleration: 0-60 mph in 5 seconds (approximately 2.46 m/s²)
* Rocket acceleration: 10 g (approximately 98.1 m/s²)

m/s² is a useful unit for measuring acceleration because it is easy to understand and it can be used to measure a wide range of accelerations. It is also a standard unit of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI).

2 m/s² means that the speed of an object is accelerating 2 meters for one second. This means that the object's speed is increasing by 2 meters per second every second.

For example, if a car is accelerating at 2 m/s², its speed will increase from 0 to 2 m/s in the first second, from 2 m/s to 4 m/s in the second second, and so on.
