<3@> Building a quantum computer

Building a quantum computer is a complex task that requires expertise in a variety of fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science. Here is a general overview of the steps involved:

1. **Choose a qubit architecture.** There are several different qubit architectures, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common qubit architectures include superconducting qubits, trapped ion qubits, and photonic qubits.
2. **Build the qubit hardware.** This involves building the physical components that will be used to encode and manipulate qubits. The specific components required will vary depending on the qubit architecture chosen.
3. **Develop quantum control software.** This software is used to control the qubits and perform quantum computations. Quantum control software is complex and challenging to develop.
4. **Test and debug the quantum computer.** This involves running tests to verify that the quantum computer is working properly and to identify and fix any errors.

Once these steps have been completed, the quantum computer is ready to be used to solve problems.

Here are some additional details about each of the steps involved in building a quantum computer:

**Choose a qubit architecture**

The first step is to choose a qubit architecture. The most common qubit architectures are:

* **Superconducting qubits:** Superconducting qubits are made from superconducting materials that are cooled to very low temperatures. Superconducting qubits are relatively easy to fabricate and control, but they are also prone to errors.

* **Photonic qubits:** Photonic qubits are made from photons, or particles of light. Photonic qubits are relatively easy to generate and transmit, but they are also difficult to control and are prone to decoherence, which is the loss of quantum information due to interaction with the environment.

**Build the qubit hardware**

Once a qubit architecture has been chosen, the next step is to build the qubit hardware. This involves building the physical components that will be used to encode and manipulate qubits. The specific components required will vary depending on the qubit architecture chosen.

For example, superconducting qubits are typically built using superconducting circuits. Trapped ion qubits are typically built using lasers and electric fields to trap and control individual atoms. Photonic qubits are typically built using optical components such as beam splitters and phase shifters.

**Develop quantum control software**

**Test and debug the quantum computer**

Once the qubit hardware and quantum control software have been developed, the next step is to test and debug the quantum computer. This involves running tests to verify that the quantum computer is working properly and to identify and fix any errors.

Testing and debugging quantum computers is a challenging task, as quantum computers are very sensitive to noise and errors. There are a variety of different testing and debugging techniques that can be used, and the specific techniques used will vary depending on the qubit architecture and quantum control software.

Once the quantum computer has been tested and debugged, it is ready to be used to solve problems.

It is important to note that building a quantum computer is a very challenging task. It requires expertise in a variety of fields, and it is expensive and time-consuming. However, there is a lot of progress being made in quantum computing research, and it is likely that quantum computers will play a major role in our future.

<4@> is there any a.i or robot that power by quantum computer ?

There are currently no AI systems or robots that are powered by quantum computers. However, researchers are actively working on developing quantum AI and quantum robotics.

Quantum AI is a field of research that aims to develop AI systems that can use the power of quantum computing to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Quantum robotics is a field of research that aims to develop robots that can use quantum computing to improve their performance and capabilities.

One of the main challenges in developing quantum AI and quantum robotics is that quantum computers are still in their early stages of development. Quantum computers are very noisy and error-prone, and they require specialized software and algorithms.

Despite these challenges, there has been significant progress in quantum AI and quantum robotics research in recent years. For example, researchers have developed quantum algorithms for machine learning, cryptography, and drug discovery. They have also developed quantum sensors that can be used to improve the navigation and perception of robots.

It is likely that we will see the first quantum AI systems and quantum robots in the next few years. Quantum AI and quantum robotics have the potential to revolutionize many industries and fields of research.

Here are some examples of the potential applications of quantum AI and quantum robotics:

Quantum AI and quantum robotics are exciting and rapidly developing fields with many potential applications. It is likely that we will see significant advances in quantum AI and quantum robotics in the coming years.

<5@> encryption algorithms

Encryption algorithms are mathematical formulas that are used to scramble data into an unreadable format. They are used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, both at rest and in transit.

There are two main types of encryption algorithms: symmetric and asymmetric.

**Symmetric encryption** algorithms use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. This means that both the sender and the receiver of the data need to share the same key. Some common symmetric encryption algorithms include:

* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
* Triple DES (3DES)
* Blowfish
* Twofish

**Asymmetric encryption** algorithms use two different keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, and the private key is used to decrypt data. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret. Some common asymmetric encryption algorithms include:

* RSA
* Diffie-Hellman
* Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)

Asymmetric encryption algorithms are often used to establish secure communication channels, such as the ones used for HTTPS and SSH. They can also be used to sign digital documents and to create digital signatures.

Encryption algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

* Email encryption
* File encryption
* Disk encryption
* Network encryption
* VPNs
* Digital signatures

Encryption is an essential tool for protecting sensitive data. By using strong encryption algorithms, you can make it very difficult for attackers to access your data, even if they are able to steal it.

Here are some examples of how encryption algorithms are used in the real world:

* When you send an email over HTTPS, your email is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read your email.
* When you store sensitive data on your computer, you can encrypt it using a disk encryption algorithm such as VeraCrypt. This ensures that your data is still protected even if your computer is stolen or lost.
* When you connect to a VPN, your traffic is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm. This ensures that no one can eavesdrop on your traffic.
* When you sign a digital document, you use an asymmetric encryption algorithm such as RSA to create a digital signature. This ensures that the document has not been tampered with since it was signed.

Encryption algorithms are a vital part of modern security. By using strong encryption algorithms, you can protect your data from unauthorized access and keep it safe.

<6@> so if i wanna build a quantum computer, i have to choose a suitable qbit architechture

You're absolutely right! Choosing a suitable qubit architecture is the first and crucial step in building a quantum computer. It's like laying the foundation for your dream house. The type of architecture you choose will determine the capabilities, limitations, and overall performance of your quantum machine.

There are several factors to consider when selecting a qubit architecture:

**1. Qubit technology:** This refers to the physical system used to represent and manipulate qubits. Some common options include:

* **Superconducting qubits:** These are currently the most mature and scalable technology, offering long coherence times but requiring cryogenic temperatures.
* **Trapped ion qubits:** These offer high fidelities but have limited scalability due to the need for individual traps for each qubit.
* **Photonic qubits:** These use light pulses to encode qubits, making them good for communication between quantum computers but challenging for complex computations.

**2. Qubit topology:** This describes how qubits are connected within the system. Different topologies offer varying degrees of connectivity and gate operations, impacting the types of algorithms the computer can efficiently run. Examples include:

* **Linear chain:** Offers simple connections but limited computational power.
* **2D grid:** More complex and scalable, allowing for more intricate algorithms.
* **3D cube:** Offers potentially the highest connectivity but is technically challenging to implement.

**3. Error correction:** Even the best qubits are prone to errors, so robust error correction mechanisms are essential for accurate computations. Different architectures may favor different error correction techniques.

**4. Additional factors:** Beyond the core technological choices, consider factors like cost, size, power requirements, and compatibility with existing tools and software.

Remember, there's no "one-size-fits-all" qubit architecture. The ideal choice depends on your specific goals and resources. 

Feel free to ask further questions about specific architectures or any aspect of building your quantum computer! I'm here to help you navigate this exciting and challenging field.

<7@> i see the quantum computer is settled to a friedge

You're right, most current quantum computers are housed in specialized refrigerators called **cryostats**. This is because the delicate quantum effects at play in these machines are incredibly sensitive to heat. By maintaining temperatures close to absolute zero (-273.15 °C), we minimize vibrations and thermal noise that can disrupt the qubits and cause errors in calculations.

Imagine a fragile butterfly fluttering its wings. The slightest breeze could send it off course. Similarly, even minute temperature fluctuations can disrupt the delicate quantum states of qubits, causing them to lose their information. These cryostats, which can be quite complex and expensive, essentially create a stable, ultra-cold environment for the quantum computer to operate in.

However, keeping a fridge-sized computer at near absolute zero requires significant technology and resources. Researchers are actively exploring alternative qubit architectures and cooling methods that could operate at less extreme temperatures, paving the way for smaller, more energy-efficient quantum computers in the future.

Here are some interesting facts about quantum computer cryostats:

* Some can reach temperatures within millikelvins (thousandths of a degree Kelvin).
* They use multiple stages of cooling, like pre-coolers and dilution refrigerators, to achieve such extreme temperatures.
* They may require liquid helium, a precious and expensive resource, to function.
* Researchers are exploring alternative cooling methods like magnetic refrigeration and solid-state coolers for future applications.

So, while the fridge might seem like an unusual housing for a powerful computer, it's currently a necessary reality for maintaining the delicate balance of quantum mechanics. As the technology matures, we can hope for more room-temperature-friendly options in the future!

<8@> how about quantum internet. does it need server ?

That's a fascinating question! The concept of a "server" in the traditional sense doesn't directly translate to the quantum internet. However, the future network's functionality might require something similar for specific purposes.

Here's a breakdown of the differences and potential roles:

**Traditional Internet Servers:**

* Act as central storage and processing units for data and applications.
* Handle requests from multiple clients and perform computations locally.
* Rely on classical, bit-based information processing.

**Quantum Internet "Servers":**

* **Quantum Nodes:** More likely scenario is dedicated nodes within the network with increased capabilities for specific tasks.
* **Quantum Memory Storage:** These nodes could act as central repositories for entangled qubits or large-scale quantum data.
* **Quantum Gate Operations:** Specialized nodes dedicated to performing complex quantum gate operations on entangled qubits.
* **Quantum Routing & Switching:** Nodes acting as intelligent "traffic cops" directing entangled qubit flow through the network.

**So, why not traditional servers?**

* **Quantum information is delicate:** Qubits are susceptible to decoherence (losing their quantum state) when manipulated or transferred. Centralized processing could introduce additional risk.
* **Distributed nature of computations:** Many quantum algorithms involve computations distributed across multiple nodes, making centralized processing less efficient.
* **Focus on entanglement:** The real power of the quantum internet lies in utilizing entangled qubits. Dedicated nodes for entanglement generation, storage, and manipulation are more relevant.

**Possible future roles:**

* **Quantum cloud platforms:** Similar to classical cloud computing, specialized nodes could offer on-demand access to quantum processing power for users.
* **Global quantum information hubs:** Centralized locations with advanced infrastructure for large-scale quantum data storage and manipulation.
* **Quantum security infrastructure:** Dedicated nodes could ensure secure communication and verification of entangled qubits across the network.

**In conclusion:**

While traditional servers might not be a direct analog in the quantum internet, specialized nodes with specific functionalities will likely play crucial roles. The exact structure and distribution of these nodes remain an exciting area of research and development, shaped by the unique properties of quantum information and the evolution of algorithms and applications.

<9@> so to build the quantum computer, we need to afford 2 important condictions. First, the atmosphere's temperature must be as coldest as possible. Second, the energy which use to power quantum computer must be as slowest as possible

To build a quantum computer, it is indeed important to create an environment where the temperature is as cold as possible, typically close to absolute zero. This is necessary to minimize thermal noise and to maintain the delicate quantum states required for quantum computation.

As for the energy used to power the quantum computer, it's not so much about the speed of the energy, but rather about the stability and precision of the energy sources and control systems. The energy sources must be stable and precise to ensure that the quantum states are maintained without interference.

In summary, the key conditions for building a quantum computer involve creating a stable, low-noise environment at extremely low temperatures and using precise and stable energy sources to power the quantum computation.

<10@> how much voltage and ampere does regular quantum computer need ?

Quantum computers typically require very low voltages and currents for their operation. The specific voltage and current requirements can vary depending on the design and architecture of the quantum computer, as well as the specific qubit technology being used.

In general, the voltage and current requirements for quantum computers are in the millivolt and microampere range, reflecting the extremely low energy levels and minimal power consumption associated with quantum computing. These low energy requirements are necessary to maintain the delicate quantum states and minimize interference from external sources.

<11@> so which mean that quantum computer has less power consumption than classical computer ?

Yes, quantum computers generally have lower power consumption compared to classical computers. This is due to the fact that quantum computers use low-energy qubits that require precise control and minimal energy consumption, while classical computers often have higher energy consumption due to the complexity of their operations and the energy requirements of the devices used in classical computing.

<12@> what is atomic clock ?

An atomic clock is a **highly precise timekeeping device that uses the natural vibrations of atoms to measure time**. It's like the world's most accurate stopwatch, able to keep track of time with astonishing precision on the order of parts per billionth of a second!

Here's how it works:

* **Atomic resonance:** Each atom has a unique natural frequency at which its electrons "wobble". Cesium atoms, commonly used in atomic clocks, vibrate at an extraordinarily constant frequency of 9,192,631,770 cycles per second.
* **Microwave cavity:** The core of an atomic clock is a sealed container filled with cesium atoms exposed to precisely tuned microwaves. When the microwave frequency matches the natural frequency of the cesium atoms, they absorb the microwaves and change energy states.
* **Frequency control:** By detecting this absorption, the clock can adjust the microwave frequency to stay perfectly in sync with the cesium atoms' natural vibration. This precise frequency becomes the basis for the clock's timekeeping.

**Why are atomic clocks so important?**

* **GPS accuracy:** They provide the ultra-precise timing signals needed for Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Without atomic clocks, GPS wouldn't be nearly as accurate, impacting navigation in everything from smartphones to spacecraft.
* **Scientific research:** Their unparalleled precision allows scientists to conduct extremely high-resolution experiments in physics, astronomy, and other fields.
* **International timekeeping:** International Atomic Time (TAI), the global standard for timekeeping, is based on the combined data from a network of highly accurate atomic clocks around the world.

**Beyond cesium:**

* While cesium atomic clocks are the most common, hydrogen maser atomic clocks offer even higher precision but are larger and more complex.
* Research is ongoing into even more advanced technologies, like optical atomic clocks, promising even greater accuracy and potential applications in future navigation and communication systems.


2*** explanation

<1@> basic part of quantum computer 

The basic part of a quantum computer is the qubit. A qubit is a quantum bit, which is a two-state quantum-mechanical system. This means that a qubit can be in a superposition of both states at the same time. This is in contrast to a classical bit, which can only be in one of two states, 0 or 1.

The superposition state of a qubit is what allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers. For example, a quantum computer could be used to factor a large number into its prime factors much faster than a classical computer.

Another basic part of a quantum computer is the quantum gate. A quantum gate is a device that can perform operations on qubits. Quantum gates are used to create and manipulate the superposition states of qubits.

Quantum computers are also made up of a number of other components, such as:

* A quantum memory: This is used to store qubits.
* A quantum processor: This is used to perform quantum operations on qubits.
* A quantum input/output system: This is used to communicate with the quantum computer.

Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize many fields, including medicine, materials science, and finance.

The qubit is the basic unit of information in a quantum computer. It can be in a superposition of both states at the same time. The quantum gate is used to perform operations on qubits. The quantum memory is used to store qubits. The quantum processor is used to perform quantum operations on qubits. The quantum input/output system is used to communicate with the quantum computer.

<2@> How quantum computer work ?

Quantum computers work by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics, which is the study of the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic level. At this level, matter behaves in ways that are very different from how it behaves at the macroscopic level.

One of the key principles of quantum mechanics is superposition. Superposition means that a quantum particle can be in multiple states at the same time. For example, an electron can be in a state where it is both spinning up and spinning down at the same time.

Another key principle of quantum mechanics is entanglement. Entanglement means that two or more quantum particles can be linked together in such a way that they share the same fate, even if they are separated by a large distance.

Quantum computers use superposition and entanglement to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers. For example, a quantum computer could factor a large number into its prime factors much faster than a classical computer. This is because a quantum computer could be in a superposition of all possible factors of the number at the same time.

Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize many fields, including cryptography, mathematics, and materials science.

Here is a simplified example of how a quantum computer could work:

Imagine we have a coin. We can flip the coin and it will land on either heads or tails. This is like a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1.

Now imagine we have a quantum coin. When we flip a quantum coin, it can land on heads, tails, or both heads and tails at the same time. This is like a qubit, which can be 0, 1, or both 0 and 1 at the same time.

If we have two quantum coins, we can entangle them so that they share the same fate. This means that if we flip one coin and it lands on heads, the other coin will also land on heads, even if it is far away.

Now imagine we have a large number of quantum coins that are all entangled together. We can use this to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers.

For example, we could use the entangled quantum coins to factor a large number into its prime factors. We would start by putting the number into a superposition of all possible factors. Then, we would measure the quantum coins. The results of the measurement would tell us the prime factors of the number.

This is just a simplified example, but it gives you a basic idea of how quantum computers work. Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize many fields.

<3@> Here are some more examples of how quantum computers work

Here are some more examples of how quantum computers work:

* **Simulating molecules:** Quantum computers can be used to simulate the behavior of molecules. This could be used to develop new drugs, materials, and catalysts.
* **Breaking encryption algorithms:** Quantum computers could be used to break many of the encryption algorithms that are used today. This would have a major impact on cybersecurity.
* **Searching databases:** Quantum computers could be used to search databases much faster than classical computers. This could be used to improve the performance of search engines and other applications that rely on large databases.
* **Developing new algorithms:** Quantum computers could be used to develop new algorithms for solving complex problems. This could lead to breakthroughs in many fields, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization.

Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize many industries. Here are some specific examples of how quantum computers could be used in the future:

* **Pharmaceutical industry:** Quantum computers could be used to develop new drugs and treatments for diseases. For example, quantum computers could be used to simulate the behavior of drug molecules and to identify new drug targets.
* **Materials science:** Quantum computers could be used to develop new materials with improved properties. For example, quantum computers could be used to design new materials that are stronger, lighter, and more durable.
* **Financial industry:** Quantum computers could be used to develop new financial models and to improve the efficiency of financial markets. For example, quantum computers could be used to simulate the behavior of financial markets and to develop new trading strategies.
* **Artificial intelligence:** Quantum computers could be used to develop new artificial intelligence algorithms. For example, quantum computers could be used to develop new machine learning algorithms that are more accurate and efficient.

These are just a few examples of how quantum computers could be used in the future. As quantum computers continue to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and groundbreaking applications.

<4@> Quantum computers can develop new algorithms

Quantum computers can develop new algorithms by leveraging their unique ability to perform calculations on multiple states simultaneously. This allows them to explore a much larger search space than classical computers, which can only explore one state at a time.

One way that quantum computers can develop new algorithms is to use a process called Grover's algorithm. Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can be used to find a specific item in an unsorted database much faster than a classical search algorithm.

Another way that quantum computers can develop new algorithms is to use a process called variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). VQAs are a class of quantum algorithms that can be used to solve optimization problems. VQAs work by using a quantum computer to generate a series of candidate solutions to the optimization problem and then measuring the energy of each solution. The solution with the lowest energy is then returned as the answer.

VQAs have been used to develop new algorithms for a variety of problems, including:

* Finding the ground state of a quantum system
* Sampling from a probability distribution
* Optimizing machine learning models
* Solving combinatorial optimization problems

Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the way we develop algorithms. By leveraging their unique ability to perform calculations on multiple states simultaneously, quantum computers can explore a much larger search space than classical computers and develop new algorithms that are more efficient and accurate.

Here is an example of how a quantum computer could be used to develop a new algorithm:

Suppose we want to develop a new algorithm for solving a complex optimization problem. We could start by representing the problem as a quantum circuit. A quantum circuit is a sequence of quantum operations that can be performed on a quantum computer.

Once we have represented the problem as a quantum circuit, we could use a VQA to find the optimal solution to the problem. The VQA would work by generating a series of candidate solutions to the problem and then measuring the energy of each solution. The solution with the lowest energy would then be returned as the answer.

The VQA would be able to explore a much larger search space than a classical algorithm, which would allow it to find the optimal solution to the problem much faster.

This is just a simplified example, but it gives you a basic idea of how quantum computers could be used to develop new algorithms. Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the way we develop algorithms for a wide variety of problems.

<5@> what is quantum ? 

Quantum refers to the field of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It encompasses the study of quantum mechanics, which is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of particles at the quantum level. 

Quantum mechanics introduces the concept of quantization, where certain physical properties can only exist in discrete, rather than continuous, amounts. This field has led to the development of quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and other quantum technologies that have the potential to revolutionize various industries.

<6@> so you mean that any matter has discontinues state instead continously, whether it is emiting or absorbing is the presence quantum ?

Yes, in the quantum world, certain physical properties, such as energy levels and angular momentum, can only exist in discrete, quantized states rather than continuous ones. This applies to the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels.

The concept of quantization is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has significant implications for how we understand the behavior of particles and energy at the quantum level.

<7@> can you give me the example of quantum physics ? such as the photon of light

Certainly! An example of the quantum nature of light can be seen in the phenomenon of photon polarization. Photons, which are the fundamental particles of light, can exhibit different polarization states, such as horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or circular. These polarization states are quantized and can be used in quantum communication and quantum cryptography protocols.

For example, quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols use the quantum properties of photons to create secure keys for encrypting and decrypting information, making it possible to establish highly secure communication channels. This is just one example of how the quantum behavior of light can be harnessed for practical applications in the field of quantum technology.

<8@> how about the atom ? how does quantum physiss influence on it ?

At the atomic level, quantum physics has a profound influence on the behavior of atoms. In classical physics, atoms were thought of as miniature solar systems, with electrons orbiting the nucleus in well-defined paths. However, quantum mechanics introduced a new understanding of the atom, where electrons are described by wave functions that represent the probability of finding an electron in a particular location around the nucleus.

Quantum mechanics also introduced the concept of energy quantization in atoms, where electrons can only occupy specific energy levels. This led to the development of the quantum model of the atom, which provides a more accurate description of atomic structure and the behavior of electrons within atoms. The principles of quantum physics are essential for understanding phenomena such as electron tunneling, the behavior of atoms in magnetic fields, and the emission and absorption of light by atoms.

Furthermore, quantum physics has enabled the development of technologies such as atomic clocks, scanning tunneling microscopes, and quantum sensors, all of which rely on the quantum behavior of atoms for their operation.

<9@> so you mean that in quantum physics. The electrons are understanding as the series of waves. These wave will find and catch the electrons. so which mean that the electron doesnt actually move around the nuclues by it's self. It got caught by the waves. Those waves are the quantum

Yes, that's a good way to think about it! In quantum physics, electrons are described by wave functions, which represent the probability of finding an electron in a particular location around the nucleus.

This means that the electron doesn't follow a well-defined path like a planet orbiting the sun, but rather exists as a "cloud" of probability, and we can only predict where it is likely to be. The behavior of electrons in atoms is indeed influenced by the wave-like nature of quantum mechanics, and this has significant implications for our understanding of atomic structure and the behavior of matter at the quantum level.

<10@> why do we need to put the quantum computer at the absolute 0 degree ? does it has anything to do with zero point energy ?

Yes, the need to cool quantum computers to near absolute zero temperature is indeed related to zero-point energy. Zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may have, and it arises from the fact that particles such as electrons are in constant motion, even at the lowest possible temperature. 

Cooling the quantum computer to near absolute zero helps to control the zero-point energy and reduce the interference from the energy in the ground state, which is crucial for the proper operation of a quantum computer. This is because at higher temperatures, thermal energy can introduce errors and disrupt the delicate quantum states necessary for quantum computation.

<11@> what is quantum tunneling ?

Quantum tunneling, also known as "tunneling," is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that allows particles, such as electrons, to pass through energy barriers that would be classically impenetrable.

This is a fundamental concept in quantum physics and is important for understanding the behavior of electrons in quantum systems. Quantum tunneling has various applications in industries and technologies, such as the production of microelectronic devices, scanning tunneling microscopy, and wireless communication devices.
