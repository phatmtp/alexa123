<10@> catobolism 

Catabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Catabolism breaks down large molecules into smaller units, such as polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins, into smaller units, such as monosaccharides, fatty acids, and amino acids, respectively. Catabolism is the breaking-down aspect of metabolism, whereas anabolism is the building-up aspect.

Catabolism is essential for all living organisms because it provides the energy needed for basic cellular functions, such as muscle contraction, protein synthesis, and active transport. Catabolism also provides the building blocks needed for anabolic reactions, such as the synthesis of new tissues and molecules.

Some examples of catabolic processes include:

* Glycolysis: The breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, releasing energy in the form of ATP
* The citric acid cycle: The oxidation of pyruvate to carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP
* Beta-oxidation: The breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used in the citric acid cycle
* Proteolysis: The breakdown of proteins into amino acids, which can then be used to synthesize new proteins or be oxidized for energy

Catabolism is regulated by a variety of hormones and enzymes. For example, the hormone insulin inhibits the breakdown of glycogen and fat, while the hormone glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen and fat. Catabolism is also affected by diet and exercise. For example, a diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat will lead to increased glycogen and fat storage, while a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates will lead to increased glycogen and fat breakdown.

Catabolism is a complex process that is essential for all living organisms. It provides the energy and building blocks needed for basic cellular functions and growth.

<11@> two phenyl rings (A and B)
