1*** information

[1] so polymer is a molecule of covalent units of matter
[2] what is ethylene monomers, how to find them ?
[3] so you mean that ethylene or ethene is a kind of colorless gas at room temperature. and it is a monomer with chemical formula as C2H4. i get it. so, how to find that gas ?
[4] example, with 1 liter of petroleum, how much ethene gas do i get from it ?
[5] so you amino has polarity aspect. which mean carbon will be be positive and hydrogen will be negative ?
[6] what is resins ?
[7] how to solve used plastic bag ?
[8] so dna of all living things are shaped as double helix shape ?
[9] side question. in resident evil movie. i know T virus is a hypothetical thing. but i saw that it has triple helix DNA structure
[10] so double helix DNA structure are popular to most of living things around. so which living thing that has triple helix DNA structure ?
[11] corona virus. what kind DNA structure does it has ?
[12] so you mean any kind of fat or oil are type of lipid ?
[13] so when i lift something, it can be lifted up by my strength, thank to ATP
[14] and when i take a rest for 3 minutes. i can restore my ATP. but i will be hungry right after. example doing gym
[15] how much dna and rna does human body has ? is it uncountable ?
[16] so okay, approximately 20 trillion DNA base pairs as total amount and weight around 0.2 grams in human body. what would happen it human body get excess that scale ? there must be some kind of mutation, i guess
[17] T REX dinosaur. how much chromosomes does it has ? DNA and RNA of it ?


2*** explanation

[1] what is polimer ?
[2] what is Rna and dna ?
[3] gene and DNA or RNA. which one come first ?
[4] where are DNA or RNA located to the cell ?
[5] what is petroleum refining ?
[6] what is carbon ?
[7] what is amino ?
[8] what is amino acid ?
[9] organic solvent 
[10] macromolecule 
[11] Genome
[12] so is it possible that DNA and RNA coexist together ?
[13] nucleotide monomer
[14] why does a nucleotide monomer consists of nitrogenous base , pentose sugar, phosphate group ?
[15] phosphodiester bond
[16] so you mean deoxyribose or ribose are some kind of sugar molecule ?
[17] lipid
[18] pentose mean 5 carbon surgar ?
[19] DNA and RNA. which one came first and where they located in the cell ?
[20] RNA has so many types such as mRNA or rRNA or rRNA or snRNA. but DNA just one ?
[21] what is ribosome ?
[22] adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
[23] ribose sugar
[24] so RNA can be single strand structure only ?
[25] so the sequence of DNA or RNA is genome ?
[26] different between Genes and DNA or RNA ?
[27] so which mean that Genes can't exist solo by it self. it need DNA & RNA as vessels to store and conduct activity
[28] the cellular machinery that you just mentioned about. is it ribosome ?
[29] and mRNA is created from DNA ? how ?
[30] where is enzyme coming from ?
[31] so you mean DNA play the key role for enzyme synthesis here. and the enzyme synthesis can be anywhere within the cell. no need to be always at ribosome
[32] i get it. so from DNA to mRNA to Polypeptide and then to be enzyme. what is polypeptide ?
[33] so you mean at first, the mRNA will be transforming into amino acid as linear chain called polypeptide. initially, polypeptide is just linear and no curve at all. but for later, through other chemical interaction, polypeptide will be folded and being curved to different forms. that is how protein or enzyme being made from synthesis process. which based on genome as a framework giving the instruction to those activities
[34] how can it knows how much is enough for that synthesis activities. does it know how much is enough for it self or is there any mechanism help it for ?
[35] how could carbon covalent forming to be hydrogen ?
[36] how carbon can form covalent bonds with oxygen ?
[37] so you mean that alcohols are created by the covalent bonding between oxygen and carbon ?
[38] what does -4 or +4 mean for carbon ?
[39] so you mean C + O2 = CO2 . that is the oxidation state of +4. C has lost 4 electrons to balance with oxygen and get CO2
[40] oxidation
[41] so how about methane. carbon and hydrogen ?
