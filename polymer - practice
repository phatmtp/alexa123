1*** information

[1] so polymer is a molecule of covalent units of matter
[2] what is ethylene monomers, how to find them ?
[3] so you mean that ethylene or ethene is a kind of colorless gas at room temperature. and it is a monomer with chemical formula as C2H4. i get it. so, how to find that gas ?
[4] example, with 1 liter of petroleum, how much ethene gas do i get from it ?
[5] so you amino has polarity aspect. which mean carbon will be be positive and hydrogen will be negative ?
[6] what is resins ?
[7] how to solve used plastic bag ?
[8] so dna of all living things are shaped as double helix shape ?
[9] side question. in resident evil movie. i know T virus is a hypothetical thing. but i saw that it has triple helix DNA structure
[10] so double helix DNA structure are popular to most of living things around. so which living thing that has triple helix DNA structure ?
[11] corona virus. what kind DNA structure does it has ?
[12] so you mean any kind of fat or oil are type of lipid ?


2*** explanation

[1] what is polimer ?
[2] what is Rna and dna ?
[3] gene and DNA or RNA. which one come first ?
[4] where are DNA or RNA located to the cell ?
[5] what is petroleum refining ?
[6] what is carbon ?
[7] what is amino ?
[8] what is amino acid ?
[9] organic solvent 
[10] macromolecule 
[11] Genome
[12] so is it possible that DNA and RNA coexist together ?
[13] nucleotide monomer
[14] why does a nucleotide monomer consists of nitrogenous base , pentose sugar, phosphate group ?
[15] phosphodiester bond
[16] so you mean deoxyribose or ribose are some kind of sugar molecule ?
[17] lipid
