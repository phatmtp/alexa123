[7] can you explain why standard scale & deviation are needed ? is it because this is weather patter project ?

You're absolutely right. Standardizing features (using mean and standard deviation) is generally a good practice for machine learning models, and it's not specific to weather data. Here's why it's important:

**Why Standardize Features?**

1. **Improved Model Performance:** Many machine learning algorithms, especially those based on distances like k-nearest neighbors or support vector machines (SVM), rely on the magnitude (size) of feature values to make predictions. If features have vastly different scales (e.g., temperature in Celsius vs. wind speed in meters per second), the algorithm might give more weight to features with larger scales, even if they are not necessarily more important for the prediction task. Standardization ensures all features are on a similar scale, giving the model a fairer ground to learn the relationships between features and the target variable.

2. **Faster Training:** Some optimization algorithms used in training machine learning models work more efficiently when features are centered around zero and have similar scales. Standardization helps these algorithms converge (find the optimal solution) faster during training.

3. **Initialization of some algorithms:** Specific algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used for dimensionality reduction require features to be centered and scaled for proper functioning.

**Weather Data Example:**

In your weather data example, even though all features might be numerical, their scales can differ significantly. For instance, temperature might range from 10 to 50 degrees Celsius, while air conditioner usage might be categorical (not much, a lot, etc.). Standardizing both features ensures they contribute proportionally to the model's learning process.

**Not a Weather-Specific Technique:**

It's important to remember that standardization is a general data preprocessing technique and is beneficial for many machine learning tasks beyond weather prediction.  For instance, you might use it in a project analyzing house prices, where features like square footage and number of bedrooms could have different scales. Standardization helps the model learn the importance of each feature relative to others, regardless of their original units.

**Exceptions to Standardization:**

While generally recommended, there can be cases where standardization might not be necessary or even harmful. Here are a few examples:

* **Algorithms insensitive to scale:** If you're using algorithms like decision trees or random forests that are not inherently affected by feature scales, standardization might not provide a significant benefit.
* **Features already on similar scales:** If your features already have comparable scales and meaningful units (e.g., all in meters or all in percentages), standardization might not be crucial.
* **Domain knowledge suggests specific scales:** In some cases, domain knowledge might suggest that the original scales of features are important. For instance, in a financial application, you might want to preserve the actual dollar values of features.

**Conclusion:**

Standardization is a powerful tool for data preprocessing in machine learning. It helps create a level playing field for features with different scales, leading to potentially better model performance and faster training. However, it's always good practice to understand your data and the specific algorithms you're using to decide if standardization is necessary.
