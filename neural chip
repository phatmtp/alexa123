[1] neural chip and implantable chip

a neural chip or neuromorphic chip is not designed to be implanted into a human brain. Instead, it is a type of specialized microprocessor that is used in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These chips are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, but they are typically used in electronic devices and computing systems to perform tasks related to pattern recognition, data processing, and other AI-related applications.

Implantable chips for the human brain, often referred to as brain-computer interfaces, are a separate area of research and technology. These devices are designed for medical and research purposes, and they are used to enable communication between the brain and external devices, or to assist individuals with neurological conditions.
