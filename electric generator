<1@> how do commutator work ?

the main job of commutator is converting ac to dc

commutator is important because of 3 things:

1- Rotating coils generate AC:

As the coils in a generator spin through a magnetic field, they experience a changing field, inducing an alternating current in the wire

the magnetic field produced by the magnets surrounding the coils.This is the most common way to build an AC generator.

as it utilizes permanent magnets or electromagnets to create a fixed and strong magnetic field around the rotating coils.

2- Commutator switches polarity:

ensuring that the current always flows in the same direction, regardless of the changing polarity in the coils.

3- Smoother DC output:

create a smoother DC output, closer to a constant flow.


<2@> so you mean that any motor with the magnetic field produced by the magnets surrounding the coils. if i remove the commutator from it, i can turn it to be ac generator ?

if you have a motor with permanent magnets surrounding the coils and remove the commutator, you essentially have the basic configuration of an AC generator.

The key to generating AC is the relative motion between the magnetic field and the conductor. In a motor with magnets surrounding the coils, the coils rotate within the magnetic field created by the magnets. This generates a changing magnetic flux through the coils, inducing an alternating current (AC) in the wires.

The commutator in a motor serves a specific purpose. Its job is to switch the polarity of the current at the right moment to maintain a constant direction for powering the motor. However, for generating AC, this switching becomes unnecessary. The AC output from the coils, even without the commutator, can be utilized directly.
