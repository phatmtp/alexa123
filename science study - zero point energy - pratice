1/ what is zero point enegy ? <1@,1***>
2/ how to generate electricity from quantum energy ? <2@,1***>
3/ Magnetic storage devices, such as hard drives and magnetic tape, use the different magnetic moments of electrons with different spins to store data <3@,1***>
4/ radiation can get through the object like wall <4@,1***>
5/ wifi <5@,1***>
6/ is wifi a radio signal <6@,1***>
7/ so radiation can be emmited from the airplane ? <7@,1***>
8/ led,ssl,OLED,PLED <8@,1***>
9/ traditional light bold using the gas to conduct the light ? <9@,1***>

2*** explanation

1/ what is quantum energy ? <1@,2***>
2/ is emf an example of quantum energy ? <2@,2***>
3/ what is photon ? <3@,2***>
4/ Blackbody Radiation <4@,2***>
5/ when the object get burning. what happend to the molecule and atom of that object ? <5@,2***>
6/ molecule of fire <6@,2***>
7/ Electromagnetic Spectrum <7@,2***>
8/ electromotive force <8@,2***>
9/ electromagnetic field and electromotive force are the same ? <9@,2***>
10/ what is quantum mechanical system ? <10@,2***>
11/ probability distribution in quantum physics <11@,2***>
12/ how different between spin of +1/2 and one with a spin of -1/2 <12@,2***>
13/ The 2p subshell <13@,2***>
14/ let's take hydrogen and oxigen for example. let's caculate their quantum number of electrons and then compare between them <14@,2***>
15/ An electron in an atom can only exist at certain energy levels, which are determined by the quantum numbers of the electron. can you explain more about that ? <15@,2***>
