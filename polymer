[1] so polymer is a molecule of covalent units of matter

You are absolutely right! A polymer is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many smaller repeating units called monomers linked together by covalent bonds.  

Think of a polymer like a long chain, where the monomers are the individual links. The chain can be very long, containing hundreds or even thousands of monomers. The properties of the polymer depend on the type of monomer and how the monomers are linked together. 

For example, the polymer polyethylene (PE), used in plastic bags and bottles, is made from ethylene monomers. The monomers are linked together in a long, straight chain. This gives PE its strength and flexibility.

Another example is DNA, the genetic material of all living things. DNA is a polymer made from nucleotide monomers. The nucleotides are linked together in a double helix shape. The specific order of the nucleotides in DNA determines the genetic code of an organism.

[2] what is ethylene monomers, how to find them ?

Ethylene, also known as ethene, is the simplest alkene. It's a colorless gas with a faint sweet odor at room temperature. Ethylene itself is a monomer, not a polymer. A monomer is a relatively simple molecule that can be linked together to form a polymer.  

Ethylene molecules have the chemical formula C2H4, which means it has two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms. The two carbon atoms are connected by a double bond.  [Image of Ethylene molecule]

**Ethylene as a Monomer**

Ethylene is the most widely produced organic compound. It's a versatile starting material in the production of numerous chemicals, including:

* Polyethylene (PE) - the most common plastic globally used in plastic bags, bottles, films, and fibers.
* Ethylene glycol - antifreeze coolant
* Ethylene oxide - used to make polyester fibers and PET plastic bottles
* Vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) - used to produce PVC pipes and fittings

**Finding Ethylene**

Ethylene isn't readily available commercially because it's a gas at room temperature. Ethylene is produced in large quantities by the chemical industry from petroleum refining and natural gas processing.  

Ethylene for industrial use is usually transported as a compressed gas or refrigerated liquid. Small amounts of ethylene can be purchased from chemical supply companies for research purposes. However, due to its flammability and potential health hazards, ethylene requires special handling and safety precautions. 

[3] so you mean that ethylene or ethene is a kind of colorless gas at room temperature. and it is a monomer with chemical formula as C2H4. i get it. so, how to find that gas ?

You've got it exactly right! Ethylene (ethene) is a colorless gas with the formula C2H4 that acts as a monomer in many industrial processes. 

However, due to its properties, finding ethylene readily available for personal use isn't likely. Here's why:

* **Industrial Production:** Ethylene is mass-produced by the chemical industry from petroleum refining and natural gas processing. It's not something typically sold commercially due to its gaseous state at room temperature.

* **Transportation and Handling:**  For industrial use, ethylene is transported as either a compressed gas or a refrigerated liquid, requiring specialized equipment and safety protocols.

* **Safety Concerns:**  Ethylene is flammable and can pose health risks if inhaled. It's not something readily available for purchase due to these safety considerations.

**Alternatives for Learning or Experimentation:**

If you're interested in learning more about ethylene, here are some safer alternatives:

* **Chemical Models:**  Molecular model kits allow you to physically build the structure of an ethylene molecule to visualize its atomic arrangement.
* **Educational Simulations:**  Several online simulations or educational apps can represent chemical reactions involving ethylene, allowing for a virtual exploration of its properties.
* **Scientific Videos:** Educational videos can visually demonstrate the industrial production processes or lab experiments involving ethylene, providing a safe way to observe its behavior.

While you can't easily find ethylene gas yourself, these alternatives offer avenues to explore and understand this important industrial building block. 

[4] example, with 1 liter of petroleum, how much ethene gas do i get from it ?

Unfortunately, it's not possible to give a simple answer of how much ethene gas you'd get from 1 liter of petroleum because the process is complex and depends on several factors:

* **Petroleum Composition:**  Different types of crude oil have varying compositions. The amount of ethane (C2H6), the precursor molecule for ethylene production, can vary significantly between different oil sources.
* **Refining Process:**  The specific refining process used plays a big role. Different refineries employ various techniques to maximize their desired product output, and ethene yield can differ based on the chosen method.
* **Refinery Efficiency:**  The efficiency of the refinery itself impacts the amount of ethene produced. Newer technologies and better practices can improve ethene yield compared to older refineries.

Due to these variations, the exact ethene output from 1 liter of petroleum can't be determined without specific details about the oil source and refining process. 

However, here's some general information:

* **Petroleum Refining Output:**  Typically, petroleum refining yields a range of hydrocarbon products, with gasoline and diesel being major components. Ethylene typically makes up a smaller percentage of the total output.
* **Industrial Scale:**  Ethylene production happens on a massive industrial scale. Refineries process millions of liters of oil daily, and the resulting ethene production is measured in tons or even thousands of tons.

If you're interested in the specific yield of a particular refinery, you might be able to find information through industry publications or reports, but this data is often not publicly available.

[1] what is polimer ?

A polymer is a large molecule composed of repeating structural units, typically connected by covalent bonds. The term "polymer" derives from the Greek words "poly" meaning "many" and "meros" meaning "parts" or "units".

Polymers can be natural or synthetic. Some examples of natural polymers include:

1. Cellulose - found in plants and used to make paper, textiles, and other materials.
2. Proteins - found in living organisms and perform various functions, such as enzymes, antibodies, and structural components.
3. DNA and RNA - the genetic material in living organisms.

Synthetic polymers are human-made and include:

1. Plastics - such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
2. Rubber - such as natural rubber and synthetic rubber.
3. Synthetic fibers - such as nylon, polyester, and acrylic.

Polymers are widely used in various industries, including:

- Packaging (plastic bags, bottles, and containers)
- Construction (building materials, insulation, and sealants)
- Textiles (clothing, carpets, and upholstery)
- Electronics (circuit boards, wires, and insulation)
- Automotive (tires, dashboards, and other components)
- Healthcare (medical devices, prosthetics, and drug delivery systems)

The unique properties of polymers, such as their versatility, durability, and ease of processing, make them essential materials in modern society.

[2] what is Rna and dna ?

RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) and DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) are two of the three major biological macromolecules, along with proteins, that are essential for all known forms of life.

DNA and RNA are both nucleic acids, which are polymers composed of monomeric units called nucleotides. The main differences between DNA and RNA are:

1. Chemical structure:
   - DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):
     - The sugar molecule in the nucleotides is deoxyribose.
     - DNA typically exists as a double-stranded helix.
   - RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):
     - The sugar molecule in the nucleotides is ribose.
     - RNA is usually single-stranded, but can also form some secondary and tertiary structures.

2. Genetic information storage:
   - DNA is the primary molecule responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information in most organisms.
   - RNA acts as an intermediary, carrying the genetic information from DNA to the protein synthesis machinery in the cell.

3. Functions:
   - DNA is the genetic material that contains the instructions for the development and functioning of living organisms.
   - RNA plays various roles in the cell, including:
     - Messenger RNA (mRNA): Carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosomes for protein synthesis.
     - Transfer RNA (tRNA): Brings the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.
     - Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): Provides the structural and functional components of ribosomes, the cellular organelles where protein synthesis occurs.
     - Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA): Involved in the processing and modification of other RNA molecules.

In summary, DNA stores the genetic information, while RNA is responsible for the expression and regulation of that information, playing a central role in the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA → RNA → Protein.

In summary, DNA stores the genetic information, while RNA is responsible for the expression and regulation of that information, playing a central role in the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA → RNA → Protein.

[3] gene and DNA or RNA. which one come first ?

DNA comes before RNA in the central dogma of molecular biology.

The central dogma describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system, and it states that the genetic information stored in DNA is first transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins.

The sequence is as follows:

1. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):
   - DNA is the primary genetic material that stores the hereditary information in the form of genes.
   - Genes are specific sequences of DNA that contain the instructions for the synthesis of proteins or other molecules.

2. RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):
   - DNA is transcribed into RNA, which serves as an intermediary molecule.
   - The information stored in the DNA is copied into a complementary RNA molecule, known as messenger RNA (mRNA).
   - Other types of RNA, such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), also play important roles in the process of protein synthesis.

3. Protein:
   - The mRNA molecule is then used as a template for the synthesis of proteins by the cellular machinery, a process known as translation.
   - The specific sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the corresponding mRNA molecule.

So, in the central dogma, the genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein, with DNA being the primary source of genetic information, and RNA acting as an intermediate in the expression of that information.

[4] where are DNA or RNA located to the cell ?

DNA and RNA are located in different parts of the cell, as follows:

1. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):
   - In eukaryotic cells (cells with a nucleus, such as plant and animal cells):
     - The DNA is located in the nucleus of the cell.
     - The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle that serves as the control center of the cell, housing the genetic material.
   - In prokaryotic cells (cells without a nucleus, such as bacteria):
     - The DNA is located in the cytoplasm of the cell, typically in a region called the nucleoid.
     - Prokaryotic cells do not have a membrane-enclosed nucleus, so the genetic material is present in the cytoplasm.

2. RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):
   - In eukaryotic cells:
     - RNA is found in various locations, including the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the ribosomes (organelles where protein synthesis occurs).
     - Different types of RNA, such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, are located in different compartments of the cell to perform their specific functions.
   - In prokaryotic cells:
     - RNA is primarily found in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in the synthesis of proteins.

The specific locations of DNA and RNA within the cell are crucial for their respective functions:

- DNA is located in the nucleus (or nucleoid in prokaryotes) to protect the genetic information and ensure its accurate replication and transmission to daughter cells during cell division.
- RNA is found in various cellular compartments to facilitate the expression of genetic information and the synthesis of proteins.

This spatial organization of DNA and RNA within the cell contributes to the efficient and coordinated flow of genetic information and the proper functioning of the cell.

[5] what is petroleum refining ?

Petroleum refining is the industrial process of transforming crude oil into useful products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, heating oils, lubricants, asphalt, and petrochemical feedstocks. This process involves several key steps and technologies to separate and convert the various hydrocarbon molecules in crude oil into more valuable products. The primary stages of petroleum refining include:

1. **Distillation (Fractional Distillation)**:
   - **Atmospheric Distillation**: Crude oil is heated in a furnace and then fed into a distillation column where it is separated into different fractions based on boiling points. Lighter fractions like gasoline and naphtha rise to the top, while heavier fractions like diesel, kerosene, and residue remain at lower levels.
   - **Vacuum Distillation**: Heavier residues from atmospheric distillation are further processed under reduced pressure to separate them into valuable products.

2. **Conversion Processes**:
   - **Cracking**: Breaks down larger, heavier hydrocarbon molecules into lighter, more valuable products. There are different types of cracking:
     - **Thermal Cracking**: Uses high temperatures.
     - **Catalytic Cracking**: Uses a catalyst to lower the temperature and pressure required, producing higher yields of gasoline and other light products.
     - **Hydrocracking**: Uses hydrogen and a catalyst to produce high-quality diesel and jet fuel.
   - **Reforming**: Converts naphtha into high-octane gasoline and aromatics by rearranging or restructuring hydrocarbon molecules, often using a catalyst.

3. **Treatment and Blending**:
   - **Hydrotreating**: Removes impurities like sulfur, nitrogen, and metals from various fractions by treating them with hydrogen.
   - **Blending**: Mixes different hydrocarbon streams and additives to produce finished products that meet specific performance and regulatory requirements.

4. **Finishing Processes**:
   - **Desulfurization**: Further reduces sulfur content to meet environmental regulations.
   - **Isomerization**: Converts straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched-chain hydrocarbons to improve gasoline octane ratings.

These processes collectively enhance the quality and utility of petroleum products, ensuring that they meet market demands and regulatory standards for performance and environmental impact. The complexity of a refinery and the variety of processes employed depend on the types of crude oil processed and the range of products desired.
